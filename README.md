# Session-to-session JMS messaging with Vaadin & Java EE 7

Communicating with live http sessions hasn't really been a design target for JSM in Java EE. Still, for Vaadin apps - especially with push support, using JMS is tempting idea. This library tries to create helper to implement this in a robust way.

ATM only slightly tested on Wildfly, cluster testing TBD.
